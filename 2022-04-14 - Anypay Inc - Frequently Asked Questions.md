### Who is Anypay for?

People who want to accept crypto as a payment option at their business. From small, owner-operated shops to large, multinational enterprises.

### How much does it cost?

Users keep 99.9% of all payments, and Anypay receives 0.1% flat fee per transaction, paid instantly and automatically at the time of payment. No bills to pay at the end of the month.

### How does it work?

Setup:

1. You enter the amount to collect in your native currency. 

2. We convert that into the amount in bitcoin (or other crypto).

3. We communicate your payment request to the customer.

Payment:

1. The customer pays with their crypto wallet.

2. We check accuracy: Wrong? "Please try again."

3. Payment goes directly to your crypto address.

### Is it custodial or not?

100% Non-Custodial. That means we never touch your funds. We never have access to your money, not even for a split second. Therefore, all payments go directly from the customer's crypto wallet to your crypto wallet with no steps in between.

### Do I have to KYC?

We DO NOT serve users in North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Lebanon, or any other country or territory sanctioned by the United States, or any other country or region where crypto services are prohibited by law. Everyone else is good to go. [Read Anypay Terms](https://anypayx.com/terms)

### Are there limits?

Not really. There are minimum payment amounts, but those limits are not set by Anypay. It varies by coin. As long you are collecting $1.00 or more, you will be fine.

### Can businesses consider as high-risk use it (e.g.: cannabis dispensary)?

Yes, as long as there is no prohibition on accepting crypto.
