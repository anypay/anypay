#Financial Regulation Compliance Policy
##Countries We Serve:

**It is impermissible, under OFAC regulations and guidance, to provide support for financial transaction software (such as the Anypay software) to countries with countrywide OFAC sanctions.**  It is also impermissible to provide customer support to any individual or company on an OFAC sanctions list.  

**Both non-cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency software companies have been subject to expensive OFAC investigations for impermissible customer support.**   An OFAC investigation could cause us to end up spending between $50,000 to $150,000 in legal fees in your defense.   It could also result, in certain instances, in significant civil money penalties being levied against you and your company at the conclusion of the investigation.  

As Anypay is a small startup that does not have the financial resources to have a complex OFAC sanctions compliance program, we mitigate our OFAC compliance risk by:

(i) geo-blocking access to our Anypay website with respect to IP addresses located in countries that are subject to OFAC sanctions and 

(ii) rejecting all customer inquiries from those locations.
