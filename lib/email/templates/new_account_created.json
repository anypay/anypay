  "body": "Our goal is to make cryptocurrency spendable everywhere. We offer a world-class merchantapp for taking cryptocurrencies at point of sale, totally private, totally free.What’s the catch?You need to hold your money yourself. We can’t hold your money for you. So you will need adigital wallet for storing your digital money. Don’t worry, there are lots of great digital wallets youcan store your cryptocurrency in. Most of them are free. Bitcoin.com has a list of trusted freewallets. The best wallet to use with Anypay is either Edge or Coinomi. Both work great. We haveno partnership with either company.So! If you have a wallet already, you will want to add your addresses to your anypay account sothat you can accept payments in digital currency, and it will be sent to your personal address.If you do not have a wallet yet, you will want to go get one. Without an address to sendpayments to, ANYPAY cannot process any payments because we do not hold your money"
