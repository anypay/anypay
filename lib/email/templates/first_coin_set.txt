First {coin} Address Set

Your business, many coins accepted

Body:
Hey there! 

I noticed you created an account with us recently and set one coin address. Did you know you can accept multiple coins from the same account?

Go to https://admin.anypay.global and sign in, go to "Settings" and then "Addresses" -- That way, your business can accept many coins all from one screen!
