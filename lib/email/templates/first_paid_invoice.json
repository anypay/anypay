  "body": "Was it you, just testing the system, or did you really get paid? Either way, you will see the payment from your invoice right away in your wallet. Go check now! See?\nYour money will go there every time. Each coin address you set will be the ones receiving payments in each respective coin. Pretty cool, huh?\n\nGo make another one and show your staff how it is done so they know what to do when a customer comes in to spend crypto at your business.\n\nBest, \n\nDerrick J Freeman\nanypay.global \n\nQuestions?
